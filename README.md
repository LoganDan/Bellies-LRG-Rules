#  General Format
This will be an LRG (Live Reality Game) heavily based on the format of the CBS competition reality show "Survivor". On Survivor, a group of strangers are divided into a number of tribes who then compete in challenges for rewards and immunity, voting each other out of the game along the way. Generally, each episode of the show encapsulates one round of the game. So, you might ask yourself, "What does a round of Survivor look like?"

##  Rounds
Each round of Survivor consists of some or all of the below, almost always in the order I have listed them. The explanations and definitions are for the television show, but I've abstracted them so that they will apply to our game as well with a few exceptions.

###  Tribe swap or merge
>####  Swap
>Players are shuffled into new tribes by some mechanism (usually randomly, but not always). They are no longer in their previous tribes and will live and compete with their new tribe until another swap or merge occurs.

>####  Merge
>Players join together into a singular tribe. They are no longer in their previous tribes and will live together until the end of the game. This marks the portion of the game where game mechanics and rewards become more about individual players than groups of players.

###  Reward challenge
Individuals or groups compete to win a reward. Rewards can be for quality of life items like food, tarps, or bathing materials; morale or emotional support like loved ones visits, letters from home, or helicopter rides; mechanical game advantages like extra votes, hidden immunity idol clues, or challenge advantages.

###  Immunity challenge
> ####  Tribe portion
> Players compete in tribes to win tribal immunity for the round. If there are more than two tribes, multiple tribes might win immunity.

> ####  Individual portion
> Players compete individually to win individual immunity for the round. Everyone, even the winner, will attend tribal council.

###  Tribal council
All players at tribal council vote for who they would like to eliminate from the game. The person eliminated leaves the game immediately.

> ####  Tribe portion
> Any non-immune tribes will attend tribal council. If there are multiple non-immune tribes, they almost always attend separate tribal councils.

> ####  Individual portion
> All players attend tribal council together even if they have individual immunity. Players eliminated at this stage usually join the jury.

## The Jury
The jury is made up of a number of previously eliminated players. Generally players who make it to the individual portion of the game are allowed to sit on the jury, but not always. At the end of the game, each juror casts a singular vote for who they think should win.

##  Game Objects
###  Challenge Idols
> ####  Tribal Immunity Idol
> The prize for winning a tribal immunity challenge. Tribes that have tribal immunity idols are immune and do not have to attend tribal council.

> ####  Individual Immunity Necklace
> The prize for winning an individual immunity challenge. Individuals that have the immunity necklace are immune and cannot receive votes at tribal council.

###  Hidden Idols or Advantages
The following is a list of hidden idols or advantages that *might* be in the game. This list is non-exhaustive. Other advantages or idols might be in play that are not described below. Generally these items are hidden within the players' living areas or in challenge areas.

> ####  Hidden Immunity Idol
> The owner may trade it in at tribal council after players have voted but before votes are read to become immune, negating all votes cast against them.

> ####  Extra Vote
> A piece of parchment hidden or given as a reward. The owner may trade it in while they are in the voting booth for an extra vote.

> ####  Vote Steal
> A piece of parchment, token, or trinket hidden or given as a reward. The owner may trade it in *before* votes are cast to take someone's vote and use it as their own.

> ####  Shot in the Dark
> A token or trinket usually given to players at the start of the game, but sometimes hidden or given as a reward. The owner may trade it in while in the voting both to have a chance (usually one in six) to become immune. If a player uses their shot in the dark, they forfeit their ability to vote.

##  Tribal Council
Tribal council is the most mechanically complicated part of the game. So, I will explain exactly how it will work for our purposes.

###  Questioning
All players attending tribal council will gather and the host will ask probing questions and try to stir up drama without revealing too much game information.

###  Voting
After the host is satisfied with the questioning, they will call upon players to vote individually by entering the voting booth and writing the name of the player they'd like to eliminate on a piece of paper and placing it into a voting urn. Players may not vote for themselves or players that have individual immunity. Players are asked to stay silent during the voting period.

###  Vote Tally
After everyone has voted, the host will tally the votes in secret by arranging them in the voting urn so that they are aware of how many votes each player has received.

###  Call for Advantages
After tallying the votes, the host will return to the players and open the floor for them to play any advantages. Players may play advantages by standing, approaching the host, handing them the advantage, and announcing who they are choosing to play it for or against (if necessary). The host will then declare what advantage has been played and any effect it may have. (Note: Not all advantages can or must be played at this time. Pay attention to the description of your advantage when you receive it to see when it can be played.)

###  Reading the votes
Once the host is satisfied that players have been given an ample opportunity to play all of the advantages or idols they'd like to play, they will begin reading the votes. The host will read votes until a player has received a plurality. Once it is no longer possible for another player to meet or exceed the number of votes received by the player with the plurality, the host will stop reading votes and announce that the player with the plurality has received enough votes to be eliminated. In other words, the host will read all votes for everyone **except** the player who is eliminated. If there are any votes that have been left unread, those votes are for the eliminated player. The number of votes remaining will **not** be revealed; however, players can conclude that the number of votes remaining would not be enough to change the outcome had those votes been cast for any other player or combinations of players. This is very specific and hard to explain. So, if you have questions or would like specific examples, please ask your host in person.

> ####  Resets
> In the event that no players have received votes, (such as if all players who received votes are immune due to hidden immunity idols) the vote will be reset. All players will vote again. After players have voted, the votes will be tallied and then read immediately. Players may not play any advantages or idols between voting and the vote read; however, all advantages played previous to the reset will carry over. For example, players who are immune from hidden immunity idols or shots in the dark are still immune and cannot receive votes; players who have had their vote stolen still may not vote; and players who have used a vote steal or extra vote will still have an additional vote. This is **not** a revote.

> ####  Revotes
> In the event that one or more players are tied for the most number of votes received (not zero), players will vote again with the new rule that they must vote for one of the players who is tied.

> ####  Deadlocks
> After a revote, if the vote is still tied, the vote will enter a deadlock. Any players who are not a part of the current tie and who are eligible to vote may publicly discuss who to eliminate from among the tied players. If all players who are eligible to vote come to a unanimous decision on who to eliminate, that player will be eliminated. If no consensus if formed, then all non-immune, non-tied players will draw rocks. The player who receives the oddly colored rock will be eliminated from the game immediately.

> ####  Fire-making
> In the event of a tribal council with only two players OR a tied vote at a tribal council with only four players where one player has individual immunity, the revote and deadlock rules will be ignored. Instead, the tied players will engage in a fire-making challenge. Players will probably not actually make a fire for the purposes of our game. Sometime before the round where a tribal council like this could occur, the host will announce what the fire making challenge will be.

## Other Rules
- If a tribe has more members than the tribe with the least members, they must sit a number of people out so that all tribes are competing with the same number of players.
- Unless otherwise allowed, players may not communicate about the game using cell-phones, computers, or other similar devices. Nor may players pass or leave behind physical notes.
- Players may not discuss the game or knowingly receive information about the game from individuals who are not playing or who have already been eliminated. Similarly, jurors should not attempt to listen in or otherwise eavesdrop on private conversations regarding the game.

##  Ending the Game
Game play continues in rounds until players have been eliminated such that only two or three remain. At that point, the power in the game will shift to the jury and Final Tribal Council will begin.
### Final Tribal Council
At Final Tribal Council, the remaining players are brought into the tribal council area to be questioned by the jury. Each finalists may give a short speech about why they think they should win. Then the jury will be allowed to ask questions. The format of the question varies from each juror taking their turn to ask a question to more open ended discussion. Jurors will be given instructions prior to Final Tribal Council about the allowed format of the questioning. When the questioning portion is done, each juror will be called upon to vote individually by entering the voting booth and writing down the name of the player they'd like to win on a piece of paper and placing it into a voting urn. After all jurors have voted, the host will tally and read the votes. The player with the plurality of votes wins the game.

> #### Ties
> If there are three finalists and no one finalist was able to receive a plurality of votes, the finalist with the least number of votes will step down and join the jury. They will cast one final vote between the two remaining finalists for who they'd like to win.
